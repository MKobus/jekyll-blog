Well, I did it. I finally created a blog. *Celebration!* 

However, there was this one tiny itty bitty issue. It was how I would do it. I refuse to use wordpress for my own projects. I'd like to think myself a genuine Web Developer, which makes me believe I should be able to prove my ability to use something other than Wordpress. So I started off my journey with the notion that I was going to spend my weekend writing a my blog with PHP. But when I mentioned it to my mother (who knows a lot about software and programming), she asked why I wouldn't consider open source code. 

Well that got me to thinking, and searching, and I stumbled upon Jekyll. Now, yes, there are many different options out there, but I chose Jekyll in the end because I remembered a co-worker raving about it recently. It was actually quite simple and nice to set up, and the more I went through the documentation, the more I realized this is possibly the most wonderful code out there for blogging from a developers perspective.

As I post this, there is still plenty to be done. And I'm never really happy with a final design, so this blog will probably be ever changing from a design perspective. But I *guess* that's ok. But here is to the kick off of my blog!
