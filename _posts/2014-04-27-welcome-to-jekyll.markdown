Well, I did it. I finally created a blog. *Celebration!* 

However, there was this one tiny itty bitty issue. It was how I would do it. I refuse to use wordpress for my own projects. I'd like to think myself a genuine Web Developer, which makes me believe I should be able to prove my ability to use something other than Wordpress. So I started off my journey with the notion that I was going to spend my weekend writing a my blog with PHP. But when I mentioned it to my mother (who knows a lot about software and programming), she asked why I wouldn't consider open source code. 

Well that got me to thinking, and searching, and I stumbled upon Jekyll. Now, yes, there are many different options out there, but I chose Jekyll in the end because I remembered a co-worker raving about it recently.
